# Who am I
    
Iâ€™m a Teaching Assistant at Emzini We Code, where I have been assisting students in writing clean code following the standards of colleges such as UC Berkeley, MIT and Stanford.
    
My background is in Information Technology with emphasis in Software  Engineering. I spent the last four years of college working at startups, hacking it at hackathons, teaching code and building my own portfolio. I also tried to launch not one, but three startups of my own.
    
I only recently finished College, and I have always wanted or desired to work as a developer for startups that are working on amazing problems. I am drawn to startups because of their iterative approach to development. 
    
My coding instructor Eric Khumalo who founded Emzini We Code bootcamp whilst working as an Intern at Twitter recruited me to work with him as a Teaching Assistant for Emzini We Code classes. The idea behind Emzini We Code is to export Silicon Valley engineering expertise as it is done in US colleges such as UC Berkeley, MIT and Stanford to Africa. My instructor and mentor did his undergrad at UC Berkeley in Data Science. Here, I assist students in understanding coding paradigms, program interpretation, algorithmic thinking and problem solving using code. 
    
Outside of work I participate in hackathons - mostly doing web app and Conversational AI development as a way to learn it more deeply. I also tutor programming to College students preparing for their exams, mainly in C++, Python and JavaScript. Iâ€™m also a mentor to a few coding enthusiasts who marvel at my journey.
    
Iâ€™m now looking for something new, a grander challenge. Iâ€™ve always loved connection with a product end user, and I really want to get involved in smaller environments too.

### Most grateful for!
I owe the success of my insightful journey in Tech to quite a number of people who have helped me in so many ways. I cannot mention them all, however I will have to give a shoutout to my mother who gave me her entire August 2017 salary so I can buy myself a laptop and start writing code, my uncle <b>Mangosuthu Mbele</b> who is my mentor, <a href="https://vuyisile.com/">Vuyisile Ndlovu</a>, the mentor who has served as the go to person whenever I needed some guidance, the guiding hand ever since I got in tech and my biggest influence on why I love Python. I am forever grateful to <a href="https://erickhumalo.com/">Eric Khumalo</a> and <a href="https://emziniwecode">EmziniWeCode</a> who have pushed me thus far. I am eternally grateful for the friends I have made through Emzini We Code.
