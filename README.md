## Software Engineer | Problem Solver | Lifelong Learner

Building innovative solutions by day, empowering the next generation by night.

I'm a driven software engineer with a passion for crafting elegant code and tackling complex problems. By day, I'm building data pipelines and wrangling intelligence at a risk management firm. By night, I'm not only fueling future tech talent as a Teaching Assistant at a leading coding school, but I'm also actively involved in building my own technology startup, QuStack, aiming to solve some of Africa's most pertinent problems in fraud-free house searching, healthcare technology, and fintech.

### Technical Rockstar

- **Data Whisperer**: My daily grind involves parsing, cleaning, analyzing, reverse engineering, packet sniffing and wrangling diverse data sets. I build efficient Python scripts and robust data pipelines to unlock hidden insights.
- **Full-Stack Fluency**: Web apps, APIs, medical solutions, city management systems - you name it, I've built it. Adept in various languages and frameworks, I thrive in dynamic environments.
- **Hackathon Hero**: A constant learner, I push my boundaries through hackathons and contests, exploring Conversational AI and web app development.

### Beyond the Code
- **Empowering the Future**: I mentor aspiring engineers, sharing my journey and the invaluable lessons learned from startups and the knowledge I have gathered along the way from some of the brightest and best thinkers and problem solvers.
- **Sharing the Knowledge**: I tutor college students, helping them master C++, Python, and JavaScript, preparing them for success.
- **Aspiring Speaker**: I am ready to take the stage and inspire others with my experiences and insights.
- **Information Catalyst**
    - Rooibos Radar (Co-founder): Curating and sharing the latest innovations and trends in technology through our newsletter (https://rooibosradar.com/).
    - Medium Blog: Regularly publish insights and analysis on tech, opinions and thoughts (https://medium.com/@andilembele).
- **Looking for**: Collaborations, challenges, and opportunities to make a real impact.

### Most grateful for!
I owe the success of my insightful journey in Tech to several people who have helped me in so many ways. I cannot mention them all, however, I will have to give a shoutout to my mother who gave me her entire August 2017 salary so I can buy myself a laptop and start writing code, my uncle <b>Mangosuthu Mbele</b> who is my mentor, <a href="https://vuyisile.com/">Vuyisile Ndlovu</a>, the mentor who has served as the go-to person whenever I needed some guidance, the guiding hand ever since I got in tech and my most significant influence on why I love Python. I am forever grateful to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/erickhumalo/">Eric Khumalo</a> and <a href="https://emziniwecode.com/">EmziniWeCode</a> who have pushed me thus far. I am eternally grateful for the friends I have made through Emzini We Code.
