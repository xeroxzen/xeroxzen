### Hello there ðŸ‘‹

I go by many names, my friends call me Google Jr because of the quantity of information I have lodged in my head. My hacker name is xeroxzen. I love code more than sharks love blood. 

I have diverse interests in code and tech holistically. Initially what brought me to this field is the belief that a lot of good can be done in the world using software. I also would like to think I have innately always been an engineer my whole life, I have been tinkering with metal scraps and breaking toys way before I could write my name.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently on my 3rd year in College.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning the MERN Stack. It's super cool.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on some cool stuff that is set to have impact mostly in Africa.
- âš¡ I am hoping to meet a lot of great individuals here whom I will learn a great deal from.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about rockets and space.
