I go by many names, my friends call me Google Jr because of the quantity of information I have lodged in my head. My hacker name is xeroxzen. I love code more than sharks love blood. 

I have diverse interests in code and tech holistically. Initially what brought me to this field is the belief that a lot of good can be done in the world using software. I also would like to think I have innately always been an engineer my whole life, I have been tinkering with metal scraps and breaking toys way before I could write my name.

- ðŸŒ± I currently work full time for First Source Technology.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on some cool stuff that is set to have impact mostly in Africa.
