### Who is Andile?
Andile is a phenomenon young man with lots of passion and ambition and an unparalled drive to be great in everything he does. Amongst his peers he's affectionately known as Google Jr because of his intellect, the way he sees things and how he knows so many things in many fields and at the same time is able to recall them without difficulty. He is a natural born problem solver and engineer at heart.

### How he got here?
After completing High School most assumed he would be heading to University to study Law or Political Science because those around him saw a debater, someone full of ideas that would be better used towards community and public policy development. 

What everyone didn't know was that in April of 2016, the last year of his High School he finally saw the light. Whilst attending a Scholastica Career Guidance workshop he finally discovered what he wanted to do and where he fit in. From that day onwards he only wanted to write code and be a damn good Software Engineer.

Nobody truly understood his change of course, they all thought it was cry for help, lack of proper guidance and many other demoralizing things. He never faltered, he finished High School and he began reading coding books encompassing Python (his favorite language), HTML, C#, C and Perl. He read coding books and did the tutorials with pen and paper. It wasn't until August 2017 he finally got a laptop for one purpose alone, to write code.

Today he is a software engineer for a tech start-up where he is the Lead Developer. He got to where he is through hardwork, sleepless nights and unparalled passion. He started at the company as an intern and because of his hunger and drive to grow he was asked to join the company's developer's team on a permanent contract. He is also at school where he is studying Computer Science, he is doing his 4th and last year.

### Most grateful for!
There are quite a lot of things he is grateful for but what ranks highly to him are the networks he has navigated for himself. He is grateful to people like <a href="https://vuyisile.com/">Vuyisile Ndlovu</a> who served as the go to person when he got on this path and the one person who got him to love Python. He is most grateful to <a href="https://erickhumalo.com/">Eric Khumalo</a> and <a href="https://emziniwecode">EmziniWeCode</a> who have pushed him thus far and always believed in him.
